## Purpose

This project is a template and parts meant to make designing projects for the <a href="https://github.com/EPL-Engineering/epl_subrack">EPL Subrack</a> easier. It's basically just a premade standardized PCB edge card used at the moment for power and a front panel template for use with the modules that fit that subrack.
