# EPL Subrack Module

Designed by Evan Foss
Primarily done in 2014
Documented 2025.03.12

## Purpose

This project is a template and parts meant to make designing projects for the <a href="https://github.com/EPL-Engineering/epl_subrack">EPL Subrack</a> easier. It's basically just a premade standardized PCB edge card used at the moment for power and a front panel template for use with the modules that fit that subrack.

As the intention is to keep the modules in use for many years as projects are built and retired recycling the housing's changing the screws from the stock ones is important.
